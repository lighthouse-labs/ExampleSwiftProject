## Lighthouse Labs Sample iOS App

This project is a barebones Xcode 9 application that sets up some of the basics according to standards for Lighthouse Labs assignment sample projects. Such things include:

* Sets the tab width to 2 spaces throughout the project
* Removes some cruft from default files (primarily AppDelegate)
* Removes the default ViewController from the project and Main.storyboard
* Has the LaunchScreen.xib and RW app icons already set up
* Has the correct company name, bundle identifier, and code signing definitions (none)
* Defaults new files to use the correct copyright information

## How To Use This

* Open the project in Xcode
* Select project in project navigator and rename the project
* Xcode will prompt to rename targets and other metafiles as well - select all of them
* Change the bundle identifier
* Change the scheme name
* Rename the top-level directory (the one that contains the .xcodeproj file)
* Update the `README.md` file to reflect the assignment.
